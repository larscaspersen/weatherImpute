\title{Patch weather data with several types of PCA methods}
\usage{
patch_pca(weather, weather_info, target, method = "nipals", nPcs = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{weather}{data.frame with columns for each weather station and rows for
each daily observation. All columns need to contain observations of the same
variable. Missing observations need to be marked with NA}

\item{weather_info}{data.frame containing the name / id of the weather station (needs
to be the same as the column names in weather), Longitude and Latitude in
decimal format}

\item{target}{character, column name in weather, on which the method should be applied}

\item{method}{character, describing which pca method is used. Valid options are
"nipals" and "ppca". For more details on the methods please refer to 
\code{\link{pcaMethods::pca}}}

\item{nPcs}{amount of principle components created in the proces of the pca
function}
}
\value{
vector, containing the imputed weather observations of target station.It is
still possible, that cases of NA remain for days none or not enough neighboring stations
had observations available
}
\description{
Takes data.frame of daily weather data of several neighboring weather stations
and imputes gaps with either the "nipals" or "ppca" method.
}
\details{
This is a simple wrapper function for the \code{\link{pcaMethods::pca}} and
\code{\link{pcaMethods::completeObs}} functions.
